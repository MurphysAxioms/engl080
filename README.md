# Fact-Finding

This project explores disinformation's dangers by testing whether users can spot fake and automatically-generated news headlines.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This project uses `Python 3.x`. I recommend install dependencies with the [pip package manager](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

### Installation

Download this project's code here:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/drewleonard/engl080.git
```
Then, create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate/
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
To run this project locally, invoke the executable:
```
$ ./run.sh
```
Additionally, navigate to `__init__.py` to modify game parameters, such as news source.

I created this project for Dartmouth College's Enlish 080: Writing with Algorithms course, taught by Professor Kyle Booten during Fall Term 2018. Two similar projects provided inspiration: [Bad News](https://getbadnews.com/#intro) and [The New York Times' disinformation quiz](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/04/technology/facebook-influence-campaigns-quiz.html).
