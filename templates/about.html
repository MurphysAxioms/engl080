                                Disinformation is intentionally-misleading information. While not new, its presence online has ballooned in recent years, with social media platforms propagating the content across their networks with large and negative impacts. Importantly, disinformation often mixes real and fake news to deceive. This characteristic makes it difficult to spot and plausible to generate automatically: actors can manipulate real news to create fake news, spinning reality effectively. It follows that this project's two goals are to: first, explore the process of generating disinformation automatically; and second, test whether individuals can spot it. In the process, this project critiques the uncertainty built into the era of social media news consumption, in which individuals look toward subjective and unfiltered sources for information.

                                This project's code passes real headlines through heuristic algorithms to generate fake headlines. First, it loads thousands of Fox News headlines into memory. Second, it finds and records their named entities and noun chunks. Third, it generates fake headlines by selecting and manipulating the real headlines randomly. For random headlines, it replaces portions of their text with random named entities and noun chunks recorded from other headlines. In doing so, it generates partly true and ideally believable—but still false—headlines. With this data, this project tests whether users can spot which headlines are real or fake.

                                This project selected Fox News for its real headlines due partly to their face-value objectivity and partly to their content's similarity to headlines from the fake news ecosystem, which emits outrageous and often right-wing messages. Websites such as Breitbart News Network mirror Fox News' general tone and content, but subvert audiences by mixing false information into the mix. As such, Fox News helped to generate partly-real and partly-false content automatically, reflecting the types of news that Breitbart and similar sources deliver. In addition, this project's game scrubs the headlines of their original dates, authorship, and capitalization to standardize output. The goal here was to capture the reality of
