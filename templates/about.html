                                Disinformation is intentionally-misleading information.[1] While not new, its presence online has ballooned in recent years, as social media platforms propagate the content across their networks with large and negative impacts. For example, disinformation campaigns are linked to violence against minorities globally,[2,3] as well as discord in democratic societies.[4] Importantly, disinformation often mixes real and fake news to deceive.[5] This characteristic makes it difficult to spot and plausible to generate automatically: actors can manipulate real news to create fake news, spinning reality effectively.<br><br>It follows that this project's two goals are to: first, explore the process of generating disinformation (specifically fake news headlines) automatically; and second, test whether individuals can spot it. This project is a litmus test for automatically-generated disinformation. As such, it critiques the uncertainty built into the era of social media news consumption, in which individuals look toward subjective and unfiltered sources for information. Additionally, this project hopes to—in an at-least small way—push back against disinformation's subversive influence by educating users about its deceptive qualities.<br><br>This project looked to two specific works for inspiration. First,  <a target="_blank" class="underline--inline" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/04/technology/facebook-influence-campaigns-quiz.html">The New York Time's quiz</a> on Facebook-circulated disinformation pointed out how difficult spotting disinformation can be. Also, it inspired this project's game format and educational mission. Second, <a target="_blank" class="underline--inline" href="https://getbadnews.com/#intro">Bad News</a> inspired this project along similar lines in testing and educating users around ideas about fake news.

                                This project's core computational method is manipulating real Fox News headlines to generate fake headlines. The general process is then passing real headlines through heuristic algorithms to generate fake headlines. Note that this project selects Fox News headlines for critical reasons (discussed below), but the algorithms work on other news headline sources as well.<br><br>This project generates fake headlines in three steps. First, it loads thousands of Fox News headlines into memory. Second, the code finds and records their named entities and noun chunks.[6] Third, the code generates fake headlines by selecting and manipulating the real headlines randomly. Specifically, it replaces relevant portions of random headlines' text with random named entities and noun chunks recorded from other headlines. In doing so, it generates partly-true and ideally-believable (but still-false) headlines. With this date, the project then tests whether users can spot fake headlines.<br><br>This project leverages Python Flask for its backend and from-scratch JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 for its frontend.

                                This project selected Fox News for its real headlines due partly to their face-value objectivity and partly to their content's similarity to headlines from the fake news ecosystem, which emits outrageous and often right-wing messages.[7] Websites such as Breitbart News Network mirror Fox News' general tone and content, but subvert audiences by mixing false information into the mix.[8] As such, Fox News helped to generate partly-real and partly-false content automatically, reflecting the types of news that Breitbart and similar sources deliver. While this project might have used other mainstream news sources (such as CNN) or non-mainstream news sources (such as Breitbart) for input headlines, Fox News had the right mix of face-value objectivity and distance to actual fake news sources to create mixed-veracity headlines automatically.<br><br>In addition, this project scrubs the headlines of their original dates, authorship, and capitalization to standardize output. While savvy news consumers would find this information helpful for estimating its veracity, also-savvy news producers would likely edit those details manually to maximize beleivability and impact. As such, in scrubbing the headlines of this data, this project assumes that news producers generating disinformation automatically would not let unbelievable metadata lower its impact.<br><br>Finally, this project chose to generate fake headlines with no human input, aside from the algorithms themselves. In reality, producers generating fake headlines automatically might review content manually before outputting it online. While this increases quality, this project showcases the automatic-only portion of the process, which is valuable in showing how little work is left for fake news producers.

                                In showcasing fake and automatically-generated news headlines, this project highlights how organizations such as Russia's <a target="_blank" class="underline--inline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency">Internet Research Agency (IRA)</a> might create fake news. Real news headlines, heuristic algorithms, and open-source code are readily-available tools in the internet era. This project also critiques how difficult it is to distinguish between real and fake news headlines, which effect manual input would likely amplify.<br><br>It follows that the ease of creating believable disinformation suggests that consuming mainstream news sources is one way citizens can push back against disinformation's dangers. Aditionally, learning to judge news sources—especially when consuming information on social media passively—is important.

                                There are at least two natural next steps that emerge from this project's weak spots. First, it should improve its algorithms to generate better (read: more believable) content. While this projects generated headlines have relatively believable structures or grammars, their scopes generally are too wide to fool individuals. Put differently, the grammar is strong but the content is weak. Finding ways to generate headlines around specific topics would be smarter, rather than generating headlines around any topics available from the input headlines. <a target="_blank" class="underline--inline" href="https://www.structuraltopicmodel.com">Stuctural Topic Models</a> (STM) would help in discovering discussed topics, which could be mapped to noun chunks and named entities.[9] To improve content further, this project might also pair headlines with images, which mirrors how some headlines appear on social media and might make the output more believable.<br><br>Second, this project should expand its output to better-educate individuals about disinformation. As it stands, this project does not guide individuals well around characteristics that make disinformation persuasive. As such, the project should show individuals side-by-side (or otherwise) the real and fake headlines, at least. Additionally, the project might also expand its seed headline sources beyond Fox News to left-wing or non-mainstream news sources.
